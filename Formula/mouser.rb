          The darwin_arm64 architecture is not supported for the Mouser
          formula at this time. The darwin_amd64 binary may work in compatibility
          mode, but it might not be fully supported.

    <<~EOS
      To configure and run mouser, create and edit the config file:
        mkdir -p "$(dirname "$(./mouser --config '?')")" && touch "$(./mouser --config '?')" && echo $_

      For examples on how to configure mouser, refer to the homepage:
        #{homepage}

      Note: The first time you run mouser you may need to provide additional
      permissions to the app:
        System Perferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility > mouser
      Once granted, restart mouser.
